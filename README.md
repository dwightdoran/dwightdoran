## I'm Dwight...husband, father, developer and problem solver

I am a Software Engineer and military veteran...
- I love working on teams and collaborating to create beautiful and intuitive user experiences and interfaces and creating scalable solutions for applications. 
- You can find me behind my computer :computer:, playing soccer with my kids :soccer: or on the lake fishing out of my kayak :fishing_pole_and_fish:
